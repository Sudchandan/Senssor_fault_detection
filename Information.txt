We Need To create a package

Created sensor folder >> __init__.py for packagae
to convert any  folder in python package we need use __init__.py
Setup.py >> Used TO create Pcakages so that it can be distributed

in reqirements.txt -e . >> first findout setup.py file and will execute it

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
setup.py needed to create a package of our project beacause we can use as library anywhere we want, in pypi if we want to upload a project/library it will be uploaded using setup.py file bcs setup.py create package all together then this package will move to pypi  

Pipeline is nothing but sequence of step>> Training Pipeline and Prediction Pipeline>> Every Piplene Have Component arranged In Specific order
Pipeline is used to mainatain a sequence and control the Execution flow,  
Component Will try to create it 

*data_access>> to get data from Mongo Db >>This folder connect with data base and create csv file

*cloud_storage : we are Going To use S3 Bucket

*Configuration : to conect with MongoDb, With s3 bucket,.. etc

*constant :Every Project reqires constant: some database name,  file name,folder name ,model name >>varible declairation 


mongodb+srv://sudeshb94:sudesh94@cluster0.nyotrwr.mongodb.net/?retryWcategorica; columnrites=true&w=majority


*Data Validation Configuration: How Many Number Of Columns we have, what is data type of every column, What are different numerical column,

*Data transformation : Standard Scaling. One hot encoding this object need to save somewhere

*Model Trainer Config : Like for hyper parameter which value will use, Expected accuracy

*Model Evaluation Config : Coampare a train model which is already in the production.

Transformation:
Robust sacaler > takes care of outlier. do scaling

Simple Imputer : data transformation component used to handle missing values in a dataset, Populate the missing vlaue


dill
pickle or dill both are similar kind of library>> both have capbale to serialize and deserialize python object
